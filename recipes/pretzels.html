        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade soft pretzels are nothing new around 
            here because this recipe has been a reader 
            favorite for years. The dough requires just 
            6 ingredients and there’s hardly any rise time, 
            so not only are these easy, they’re pretty 
            quick too. In fact, I remember feeling pleasantly 
            surprised at the ease and speed the first time I 
            made them—it took us only 30 minutes to make 1 batch! 
            Over the years, I’ve added a smidge of melted butter 
            to the dough for improved flavor. Furthermore, 
            we’ve introduced the baking soda bath. While it 
            sounds strange, this step is what gives pretzels 
            that iconic flavor, chewy texture, helps deepen 
            their golden color in the oven, and locks in the 
            super soft interior. If you get the water boiling 
            ahead of time, it really only adds 5 minutes to the 
            entire process. We do it every time now. It’s worth it!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>2 and 1/4 tsp instant or active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Coarse salt for sprinkling</li>
            <li>Baking soda bath
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup baking soda</li>
                    <li>9 cups water</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk yeast into warm water and let sit for 1 minute.
                Whisk in salt, sugar, and melted butter. Slowly add 3 cups
                of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon until
                dough is thick. Add 3/4 cup more flour until dough is no
                longer sticky. If dough is still sticky, add 1/4-1/2 cup more,
                as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the dough for 5 minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky,
                sprinkle some flour on the work surface. Poke the dough with a
                finger--if it slowly bounces back, it is ready to rise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape the kneaded dough into a ball and cover with a towel. Let
                rest for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preaheat oven to 400°F and bring baking soda and 9 cups water 
                to a boil. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper
                or silicone baking mats. If using parchment paper, lightly spray
                with non-stick spray or grease with butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 1/3-cup sections.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the dough sections into 20-22 inch ropes. Twist into pretzel shape.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drop 1-2 pretzels into the baking soda bath for 20-30 seconds.
                Using a slotted spatula, lift the pretzels out and allow excess
                water to drip off. Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet.
                Sprinkle the top with coarse sea salt. Repeat with remaining
                pretzels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven and serve warm.
            </li>
        </ol>
