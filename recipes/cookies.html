        <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
        <img src="images/cookies.jpg">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I used to beg my mom to let me make chocolate 
            chip cookies for two reasons. First, she had 
            a beautiful blue KitchenAid stand mixer that 
            I always wanted to use, and second, because 
            I loved baking. I chose cookies specifically 
            because I knew she wouldn’t say no to them. 
            It was really a win-win for both of us. Our 
            favorite recipe was the one on the back of 
            the Nestlé Toll House bag of semisweet 
            chocolate morsels. Little did we know that 
            the recipe printed there was steeped in 
            history, a modernized version of the first-ever 
            chocolate chip cookie recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped nuts</li>
            <li>2 (7-ounce) bars semi-sweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees farenheit and line
                two large baking sheets with parchment paper
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together 
                in a large bowl using a hand mixer on low speed. 
                Add eggs one at a time, mixing until combined.
                Mix in vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sift flour and baking soda over a medium bowl. Stir 
                in salt. Add to the butter mixture and mix well until 
                combined. Add nuts and chocolate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drop rounded tablespoons of dough on the prepared baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool 
                slightly before transferring to a wire rack to finish 
                cooling.
            </li>
        </ol>
