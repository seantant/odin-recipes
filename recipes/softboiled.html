        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There’s something so crave-able about a perfect soft boiled egg. The tender white, the runny yolk. If you ask me, it’s something everyone should know how to make. It takes minutes, it requires 1 ingredient, and it’s an easy way to add protein and healthy fats to just about anything! Want to round out a salad or turn a slice of toast into a meal? Put a soft boiled egg on it.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 to 4 large eggs</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fill a medium pot with water and bring to a boil. 
                Using a slotted spoon lower the eggs into the water and
                let simmer for 7 minutes. Prepare a bowl of ice water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the eggs and immediately place into the ice water.
                Let chill until the eggs are cool enough to handle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully crack the eggs to remove the shell. You can use 
                a spoon to loosen the egg from the shell.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season eggs with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
